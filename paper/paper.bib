Openness should become the default case respecting constraints to privacy, national security and intellectual property rights. For making open science happen, two major pillars need to be addressed. Data needs to be {FAIR} (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to overcome the fragmentation and inefficiencies and thus to increase data reuse effectively. Commissioner Moedas made clear that "Europe's final transition must be one from fragmented data sets to an integrated European Open Science Cloud ({EOSC})". By 2020, all European researchers need to be able depositing, accessing and analyzing European scientific data through the {EOSC}. {EOSC} and {FAIR} research data are closely related and the {EC} is working out phases for implementing {EOSC} and action plans to make data {FAIR}.},

	abstract = {This paper describes {GCAM} v5.1, an open source model that represents the linkages between energy, water, land, climate, and economic systems. {GCAM} is a market equilibrium model, is global in scope, and operates from 1990 to 2100 in 5-year time steps. It can be used to examine, for example, how changes in population, income, or technology cost might alter crop production, energy demand, or water withdrawals, or how changes in one region’s demand for energy affect energy, water, and land in other regions. This paper describes the model, including its assumptions, inputs, and outputs. We then use 11 scenarios, varying the socioeconomic and climate policy assumptions, to illustrate the results from the model. The resulting scenarios demonstrate a wide range of potential future energy, water, and land uses. We compare the results from {GCAM} v5.1 to historical data and to future scenario simulations from earlier versions of {GCAM} and from other models. Finally, we provide information on how to obtain the model.},
