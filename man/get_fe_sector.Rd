\description{
Compute final energy.
GPK 1/6/2022 - because some reporting categories are mapped from both the sector-level and subsector-level queries,
we need a step of aggregation here. For example, international and domestic air are both assigned to
aviation; international is mapped from the sector-level query, and domestic is mapped from the subsector (mode).
Without this step there would be duplicate entries with different data for the same reporting categories.
