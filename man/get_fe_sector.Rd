\title{Compute and aggregate final energy by sector.}
\usage{
get_fe_sector()
}
\value{
`fe_sector_clean` global variable.
}
\description{
This function consolidates final energy data by handling overlaps between sector-level and subsector-level queries.
For instance, both international and domestic air transport are categorized under aviation, but are sourced from different queries:
international from the sector-level and domestic from the subsector-level. This aggregation step prevents duplicate entries
with inconsistent data for the same reporting categories.
