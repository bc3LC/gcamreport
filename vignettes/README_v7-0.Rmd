In addition, `gcamreport` includes an interactive user widget that allows users to generate and download plots live, as well as download reduced versions of the formatted dataset in spreadsheet format.

The [light mode installation](#with-R-light-mode-installation) requires only R as it installs the `gcamreport` package directly from the GitHub repository. It is suitable for general use of the package but not compatible with the user interface. The [full mode installation](#with-R-full-mode-installation) requires R, Rstudio and cloning the GitHub repository. It is suitable for general use of the package and allows you to launch the user interface. It is also the best option if you are actively developing or modifying the `gcamreport` package, as it allows you to modify the mappings and functions to create suitable versions for your GCAM model.

Docker provides you with an already updated environment suitable for running the `gcamreport` package.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   -   Git (to download, click [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

                                                                                                                                                                                                   2.  Open git bash in the folder where you want to clone the repository and clone it:

                                                                                                                                                                                                     ``` bash
                                                                                                                                                                                                   git clone https://github.com/bc3LC/gcamreport.git
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                   3.  Open Docker Desktop (double-click the icon on your computer) and leave it running in the background.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   4.  Inside a terminal (bash or cmd) pull the docker image:

                                                                                                                                                                                                     ``` bash
                                                                                                                                                                                                   docker pull claudiarodes/gcamreport_docker:gcam-v7.0-v2
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                   **Note**:exclamation:: This step requires 13.5GB of free space in your computer.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   5.  Run the Docker container using your full path to the `gcamreport` folder:

                                                                                                                                                                                                     ``` bash
                                                                                                                                                                                                   docker run -v /path/to/gcamreport:/app -p 4000:3838 -it claudiarodes/gcamreport_docker:gcam-v7.0-v2
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                   This should prompt an R console in your terminal.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   6.  Install the `gcamreport` package in the new R console:

                                                                                                                                                                                                     ``` r
                                                                                                                                                                                                   remotes::install_github("bc3LC/gcamreport") #you can skip all updates in case you are asked
                                                                                                                                                                                                   library(gcamreport)
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                   Now `gcamreport` package is fully loaded. Enjoy! :smile:

Inside the R session it is referred to as `/app`.

                                                                                                                                                                                                           - Dataset generation: It creates or loads an existing project and automatically saves the generated dataset that meets the reporting requirements of the [IAMC](https://www.iamconsortium.org/). Main function: `generate_report()`. For more information, see this [tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Dataset_Generation_Tutorial.html) or type `??generate_report` in your R console. If you get any warning or error messages, you might want to look at the [Warnings and Error Messages](#bugs) section.

                                                                                                                                                                                                             - Interactive user block: it launches an interactive widget that displays the dataset in tabular form, with the ability to filter, reorder and download live. It also displays plots and allows them to be downloaded, aggregated by variables, regions and scenarios. Main function: `launch_gcamreport_ui()`. For more information see this [tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Interactive_UI_Tutorial.html) or type `??launch_gcamreport_ui` in your R console. If you get any warning or error messages, it might be useful to have a look at the [Warnings and Error Messages](#bugs) section.

These can be changed by the user as detailed in [this tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Modify_Mapping_Template_Tutorial.html).

For example, if in the `gcamreport` folder you have a folder called `amazingData` with your dataset `myData.dat`, you should refer to it as
