## Example 1: launch UI when generating the dataset

When running the main function `generate_report` (see [Dataset Generation Tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport//articles//Dataset_Generation_Tutorial.html) for more information), simply set `launch_ui` to `TRUE` or do not specify anything since this is the default option.

``` r
generate_report(..., launch_ui = TRUE)    # this is the default option
```
<span style="color:white">newline</span>







## Example 2: launch UI once the dataset has been generated

After generating an `.RData` dataset with the `generate_report()` function, simply run `launch_gcamreport_ui` in R specifying either the dataset variable or the path to the `.RData` dataset. It should be something like `/path/to/your/database/..._standardize.RData` or `/path/to/your/project_file/..._standardize.RData`. 

``` r
# lanuch the user interface specifying the dataset variable name
launch_gcamreport_ui(data = report)  # report is the name of the standardized 
                                     # dataset generated by generate_report() 
                                     # function. So, if you see it loaded in 
                                     # your environment, you can easily use 
                                     # it here!! :)

# lanuch the user interface specifying the dataset path
launch_gcamreport_ui(data_path = "/path/to/your/database/..._standardize.RData")
```

## Troubleshooting when launching the UI

#### A) Large error when launching the UI

When running `launch_gcamreport_ui(data_path = "path/to/your/data.RData")`, you might get this message:


    launch_gcamreport_ui(data_path = "examples/example3.RData")

**Possible solution 1**: make sure that you cloned the repo. Check the instructions [here](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#installation-guide).

**Possible solution 2**: make sure that you are using the `gcamreport` Rproject and that the R session working directory points the `gcamreport` cloned folder. In addition:

-   In case you are using the `gcamreport` package following the [R installation](#with-r), try to copy the whole path to your data, for instance `data_path = C:\Users\username\Documents\path\to\your\gcamfolder\examples\example3.RData` if you are using a Windows distribution.

-   In case you are using the `gcamreport` package following the [Docker installation](#with-docker):

    a)  make sure that your dataset is inside the `gcamreport` folder.

    b)  make sure that you typed correctly the path to your `gcamreport` folder when generating the docker image (5th step in the [Docker section](#with-docker))

    c)  make sure that you are pointing correctly to your dataset. For example, if in the `gcamreport` folder you have a folder called `examples` with your dataset `amazingDataset.RData`, you should refer to it as

``` r
# option 1: full path
generate_report(data_path = "/app/examples/amazingDataset.RData")

# option 2: partial path
generate_report(data_path = "examples/amazingDataset.RData")
```

#### B) Short error when launching the UI

When launching the UI either through R, Rstudio or Docker, you might get this message:


    Error in `shinyAppDir()`:
    ! No Shiny application exists at the path "inst/gcamreport_ui"


**Possible solution 1**: make sure that you are using the `gcamreport` package through Rstudio (following the full R installation) or Docker. Otherwise the UI can not be launched. Check the installation instructions [here](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#installation-guide).

**Possible solution 2**: make sure that you have a folder called `inst/gcamreport_ui` in your working session. It might be that your working directory has changed. To check it, run `getwd()` on your R console. If necessary, set again the working environment with `setwd()`.



#### C) Wired message when launching the UI using the Docker installation.

After using the functions `generate_report()` or `launch_gcamreport_ui()` to launch the UI, you might get this message:

    Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3838
    /usr/bin/xdg-open: 882: www-browser: not found
    /usr/bin/xdg-open: 882: links2: not found

    xdg-open: no method available for opening 'http://127.0.0.1:3838' 

</summary>

This is not an error! You simply need to either go to your Docker Desktop program and click the last started port

or open this url <http://localhost:4000> in your favourite browser.




#### D) Error when using the UI through Docker installation.

When opening your *localhost*, you might see this error:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc3LC/gcamreport/gcam-v7.0/vignettes/readme_fig/shiny_error2.png" title="UI error" alt="UI error" width="40%" height="40%"/>

</summary>

**Possible solution**: your UI is not running. Try to either use the `generate_report()` function or the `launch_gcamreport_ui()`.
