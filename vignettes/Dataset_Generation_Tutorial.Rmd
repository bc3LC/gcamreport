To see all possiblities of the `run()` function, look [here](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/reference/run.html).

## Example 1: generate a dataset from a project

Assume you have a project called `myProj.dat` and are willing to generate a dataset meeting the reporting requirements of the [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/). With the `run` function, it will be generated and automatically saved in the same folder where `myProj.dat` is.

``` r
## -- load gcamreport library.
library(gcamreport)

## -- store the project path in a variable.
mypath <- "/path/to/project/myProj.dat"
# Notice that the extension is included. Accepted extensions: .dat & .proj.
# ATENTION: in case you followed the Docker installation, you should store your project data inside the gcamreport folder and your root directory is called "/app". Thus, your path will be something like "/app/myProj.dat".

## -- generate the dataset until 2050. 
run(project_path = mypath, final_year = 2050, launch_ui = FALSE)
# Notice that it will automatically be saved in "/path/to/project/myproj_ipcc_report.csv". The terminal will output the verifications done and their result.
```

## Example 2: generate a dataset from a database

Assume you have a database called `myDb` in a folder named `dbFolder` and are willing to generate a dataset meeting the reporting requirements of the [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) for several scenarios: `scen1`, `scen2`, and `scen3`. With the `run` function, it will be generated and automatically saved in the same folder where `myDb` is.

``` r
## -- load gcamreport library.
library(gcamreport)

## -- store the database path and name, the query path, the desired project name, and the considered scenarios in variables.
dbpath <- "/path/to/database"
dbname <- "gcamdb_name"
querypath <- "/path/to/queries"
projname <- "awesomeProj.dat"
scen <- c('scen1', 'scen2', 'scen3')
# Notice that the extension is included in the project name. Accepted extensions: .dat & .proj.
# ATENTION: in case you followed the Docker installation, you should store your database inside the gcamreport folder and your root directory is called "/app". Thus, your database path will be something like "/app/database".

## -- generate the dataset until 2075. 
run(db_path = dbpath, query_path = querypath, db_name = dbname, prj_name = projname, scenarios = scen, final_year = 2075, launch_ui = FALSE)
# Notice that it will automatically be saved in "/path/to/database/awesomeProj_ipcc_report.csv". The terminal will output the verifications done and their result.
```

## Troubleshooting for the `run()` function

#### A) Error on `run("path/to/your/data/myData.dat")`

In your R console, you might see this error:

    > run("path/to/your/data/myData.dat")
    [1] "Loading project..."
    [1] "Loading data, performing checks, and saving output..."
    [1] "ag_demand_clean"
    Error in rgcam::getQuery(prj, "demand balances by crop commodity") :
      getQuery: Query demand balances by crop commodity is not in any scenarios in the data set.

This problem is due to a wrong path specification.

**Possible solution**: make sure that you specified correctly the path. In addition:

-   In case you are using `gcamreport` package following the [R installation](#with-r), try to copy the whole path to your data, for instance `C:\Users\username\Documents\path\to\your\data\myData.dat` if you are using a Windows distribution.

-   In case you are using `gcamreport` package following the [Docker installation](#with-docker):

    a)  make sure that your data is inside the `gcamreport` folder.

    b)  make sure that you type correctly the path to your `gcamreport` folder when running the docker image (5th step in the [Docker section](#with-docker))

    c)  make sure that you are pointing correctly to your data. For example, if in the `gcamreport` folder you have a folder called `amazingData` with your dataset `myData.dat`, you should refer to it as

``` r
# option 1: full path
run("/app/amazingData/myData.dat")

# option 2: partial path
run("amazingData/myData.dat")
```

#### B) Error related to *system* when using the Docker installation.

Once the R console is opened, you might see this message after introducing any command:

    System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.
    Failed to connect to bus: Host is down
    Warning message:
    In system("timedatectl", intern = TRUE) :
       running command 'timedatectl' had status 1 

**Possible solution**: simply type `Ctrl+C` and run your command again.
