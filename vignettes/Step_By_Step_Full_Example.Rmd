In this tutorial, we will 1) generate a dataset from a provided GCAM7.0 database and run the associated user interface and 2) generate a dataset from a provided project and run the corresponding user interface. To know more about the `gcamreport` package possibilities, look at these tutorials: [dataset generation tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Dataset_Generation_Tutorial.html) and [user interface tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Interactive_UI_Tutorial.html).

## Example 1: step-by-step standardized dataset generation from a provided database

1) Follow the [installation guide](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#installation-guide) either with R Studio or Docker

2) Download the example [GCAM6.0 database](https://zenodo.org/record/8162970), store it inside `gcamreport/examples`, and unpack it.

3) Generate the standardized dataset:

``` r
## -- load gcamreport library.
library(gcamreport)

## -- store the database path, name, and scenarios in a variable.
dbpath <- "examples"
dbname <- "database_basexdb_ref"
scen <- "Reference"

## -- choose a project name
prjname <- "example1.dat"

## -- generate the dataset until 2025, save the output in .csv and .xlsx format, and lunch the user interface
run(db_path = dbpath, db_name = dbname, scenarios = scen, prj_name = prjname, final_year = 2025, save_output = TRUE, launch_ui = TRUE)
```
**Note**: project generation requires approximately 30 minutes.

4) Once the project has been generated and the standardized dataset created, the user interface will prompt. If you are using R Studio, it will automatically open. For a better experience, click the `open in browser` button. If you are using Docker, either type <http://localhost:4000> in the browser or go to Docker Desktop and click the last started port.

5) Check the generated dataset: look at `examples` folder and you should see a file called `example1_iamc_report.csv` and a file called `example1_iamc_report.xlsx` containing the standardized dataset.

6) Notice that in the `examples` folder a file called `database_basexdb_ref_example1.dat` has appeared. It is the generated project file from the provided database. In case you want to generate the standardized dataset again or to open the user interface, you can use directly this file and avoid creating the project again. If you whish to proceed as mentioned, you can follow [Example 2](#example2).

## Example 2: step-by-step standardized dataset generation from a provided project {#example2}

1) Follow the [installation guide](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#installation-guide) either with R Studio or Docker

2) In this example we will use an example dataset stored in `examples` called `example2.dat`

3) Generate the standardized dataset:

``` r
## -- load gcamreport library.
library(gcamreport)

## -- store the database path, name, and scenarios in a variable.
projectpath <- "examples/example2.dat"

## -- generate the dataset until 2025, save the output in .csv and .xlsx format, and lunch the user interface
run(project_path = projectpath, final_year = 2025, save_output = TRUE, launch_ui = TRUE)
```

4) Once the project has been generated and the standardized dataset created, the user interface will prompt. If you are using R Studio, it will automatically open. For a better experience, click the `open in browser` button. If you are using Docker, either type <http://localhost:4000> in the browser or go to Docker Desktop and click the last started port.

5) Check the generated dataset: look at `examples` folder and you should see a file called `example2_iamc_report.csv` and a file called `example2_iamc_report.xlsx` containing the standardized dataset.
