In this tutorial, we will 1) generate a dataset from a provided GCAM7.0 database and launch the associated user interface, 2) generate a dataset from a provided project and launch the corresponding user interface, and 3) launch the user interface from a provided standardized dataset. To know more about the `gcamreport` package possibilities, look at these tutorials: [dataset generation tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Dataset_Generation_Tutorial.html) and [user interface tutorial](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Interactive_UI_Tutorial.html).

## Example 1: step-by-step standardized dataset generation from a provided database

1) Follow the [installation guide](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#installation-guide) either with R or Docker.

2) Download the example [GCAM7.0 database](https://zenodo.org/records/10258919), store it inside `gcamreport/examples`, and unpack it. Make sure that the database is directly located in `gcamreport/examples/database_basexdb_ref` and an intermediate folder has not appeared.

3) Load the `gcamreport` library. If you are using Rstudio or Docker, run

``` r
devtools::load_all()
```

and if you are using R, run

``` r
library(gcamreport)
```

4) Generate the standardized dataset:

``` r
## -- store the database path, name, and scenarios in a variable.
dbpath <- "examples"
dbname <- "database_basexdb_ref"
scen <- "Reference"

## -- choose a project name
prjname <- "example1.dat"

## -- generate the reporting dataset until 2050 for EU-12 and EU-15 for all the 
## -- Agricultural variables, save the output in .RData, .csv and .xlsx format, 
## -- and lunch the user interface
generate_report(db_path = dbpath, db_name = dbname, scenarios = scen, 
                prj_name = prjname, final_year = 2050, 
                desired_regions = c('EU-12', 'EU-15'), 
                desired_variables = c('Agricultural*'), 
                save_output = TRUE, launch_ui = TRUE)
```

In case you experience some trouble, check this [troubleshooting section](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Dataset_Generation_Tutorial.html#troubleshooting-for-the-generate_report-function). 


5) Once the project has been generated and the standardized dataset created, the user interface will prompt. If you are using Rstudio, it will automatically open. For a better experience, click the `open in browser` button. If you are using Docker, either type <http://localhost:4000> in the browser or go to Docker Desktop and click the last started port.

**Note**: Remember that the user interface can only be launched through the [full R installation](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#with-r-full-mode-installation) or the [Docker installation](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#with-docker).

6) Check the generated dataset: look in the `examples` folder and you should see two files named `example1_standardized.csv` and `example1_standardized.xlsx` containing the standardized dataset. 

7) Note that a file called `database_basexdb_ref_example1.dat` has appeared in the `examples` folder. This is the generated project file from the provided database. If you want to rebuild the standardized dataset or launch the user interface, you can use this file directly and avoid rebuilding the project. If you want to proceed as mentioned, you can follow [Example 2](#example2).

8) Note that a file named `example1_standardized.RData` has appeared in the `examples` folder. This is the report file generated from the provided database. If you want to launch the user interface in the future, you can use this file directly and avoid creating or loading the project again. If you want to proceed as mentioned, you can follow [Example 3](#example3).

## Example 2: step-by-step standardized dataset generation from a provided project {#example2}

1) Follow the [installation guide](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#installation-guide) either with R or Docker

2) In this example we will use an example rgcam project stored in `examples` called `example2.dat`

3) Load the `gcamreport` library. If you are using Rstudio or Docker, run

``` r
devtools::load_all()
```

and if you are using R, run

``` r
library(gcamreport)
```

4) Generate the standardized dataset:

```r
## -- store the project path and name in a variable.
prjname <- "examples/example2.dat"

## -- generate the reporting dataset until 2050 for EU-12 and EU-15 for all the 
## -- Agricultural variables, save the output in .RData, .csv and .xlsx format, 
## -- and lunch the user interface
generate_report(prj_name = prjname, final_year = 2050, 
                desired_regions = c('EU-12', 'EU-15'),
                desired_variables = c('Agricultural*'), 
                save_output = TRUE, launch_ui = TRUE)
```
In case you experience some trouble, check this [troubleshooting section](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Dataset_Generation_Tutorial.html#troubleshooting-for-the-generate_report-function).

5) Once the project has been generated and the standardized dataset created, the user interface will prompt. If you are using Rstudio, it will automatically open. For a better experience, click the `open in browser` button. If you are using Docker, either type <http://localhost:4000> in the browser or go to Docker Desktop and click the last started port.

**Note**: Remember that the user interface can only be launched through the [full R installation](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#with-r-full-mode-installation) or the [Docker installation](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#with-docker).

6) Check the generated dataset: look in the `examples` folder and you should see two files named `example2_standardized.csv` and `example2_standardized.xlsx` containing the standardized dataset.

7) Note that a file called `example2_standardized.RData` has appeared in the `examples` folder. This is the report file generated from the provided database. If you want to launch the user interface in the future, you can use this file directly and avoid creating or loading the project again. If you want to proceed as mentioned, you can follow [Example 3](#example3).

## Example 3: step-by-step user interface launching from a provided standardized dataset {#example3}

**Note**: Remember that the user interface can only be launched through the [full R installation](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#with-r-full-mode-installation) or the [Docker installation](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#with-docker).

1) Follow the [installation guide](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/index.html#installation-guide) either with the R full installation or the Docker installation.

2) In this example we will use a standardized example dataset stored in `examples` called `example3.RData`.

3) Load the `gcamreport` library:

``` r
devtools::load_all()
```

4) Launch the user interface for the standardized dataset:

``` r
## -- load gcamreport library.
devtools::load_all() # if using Rstudio or Docker
library(gcamreport) # if using R

## -- store the project path and name in a variable.
datapath <- "examples/example3.RData"

## -- launch the user interface
launch_gcamreport_ui(data_path = datapath)
```
In case you experience some trouble, check this [troubleshooting section](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/articles/Interactive_UI_Tutorial.html#troubleshooting-when-launching-the-ui-with-the-docker-installation).


5) Once the project has been generated and the standardized dataset created, the user interface will prompt. If you are using Rstudio, it will automatically open. For a better experience, click the `open in browser` button. If you are using Docker, either type <http://localhost:4000> in the browser or go to Docker Desktop and click the last started port.

6) If you just ran [Example 1](#example1) or [Example 2](#example2), you should have a variable called `report` in the environment. You can also use it to launch the user interface:

``` r
## -- load gcamreport library.
devtools::load_all() # if using Rstudio or Docker
library(gcamreport) # if using R

## -- store the database path, name, and scenarios in a variable.
dataname <- "report"

## -- launch the user interface
launch_gcamreport_ui(data = dataname)
```
