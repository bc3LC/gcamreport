To see all possibilities of the `run()` function, look [here](https://bc3lc.github.io/gcamreport/reference/run.html).

<span style="color:white">newline</span>









## Example 1: generate a dataset from a database {#example1}

Assume you have a database called `myDb` in a folder named `dbFolder` and are willing to generate a standardized dataset for several scenarios: `scen1`, `scen2`, and `scen3`. With the `run` function, it will be generated and automatically saved in the same folder where `myDb` is.

1) Load `gcamreport` library.

``` r
library(gcamreport)
```

2) Store the database path and name, the query path, the desired project name, and the considered scenarios in variables.

``` r
dbpath <- "/path/to/database"
dbname <- "gcamdb_name"
prjname <- "awesomeProj.dat"
scen <- c('scen1', 'scen2', 'scen3')
```

Notice that the extension is included in the project name. Accepted extensions: `.dat` & `.proj`.

**Note**: in case you followed the Docker installation, you should store your database inside the `gcamreport` folder and your root directory is called `/app`. Thus, your database path will be something like `/app/path/to/database`.

3) Generate the dataset until the desired year. In this example, 2050. By default is 2100 and it should be at least 2025.

``` r
run(db_path = dbpath, query_path = querypath, db_name = dbname, prj_name = prjname, scenarios = scen, final_year = 2050, launch_ui = FALSE)
```

**Note**: project generation requires approximately 30 minutes.

Notice that the dataset will automatically be saved in `.csv` and `.xlsx` at `/path/to/database/awesomeProj_iamc_report.csv` and `/path/to/database/awesomeProj_iamc_report.xlsx`.

This procedure will generate a project file at `/path/to/database/dbname_prjname.dat` with all the necessary queries that you can use as indicated in [Example 2](#example2).

The terminal will output the performed verifications and their final status.

## Example 2: generate a dataset from a project {#example2}

Assume you have a project called `myProj.dat` and are willing to generate a standardized dataset out of it. With the `run` function, it will be generated and automatically saved in the same folder where `myProj.dat` is. Notice that `myProj.dat` should have all the required queries for the standardized dataset generation. If you are not sure you have all of them or you need to generate the project, see [Example1](#example1).


1) Load `gcamreport` library.

``` r
library(gcamreport)
```


2) Store the project path in a variable.

``` r
mypath <- "/path/to/project/myProj.dat"
```

Notice that the extension is included. Accepted extensions: `.dat` & `.proj`.

**Note**: in case you followed the Docker installation, you should store your database inside the `gcamreport` folder and your root directory is called `/app`. Thus, your database path will be something like `/app/path/to/database`.


3) Generate the dataset until the desired year. In this example, 2050. By default is 2100 and it should be at least 2025.

``` r
run(project_path = mypath, final_year = 2050, launch_ui = FALSE)
```

Notice that the dataset will automatically be saved in `.csv` and `.xlsx` at `/path/to/database/awesomeProj_iamc_report.csv` and `/path/to/database/awesomeProj_iamc_report.xlsx`.

The terminal will output the performed verifications and their final status.

## Example 3: save or not the output and specify the file format or the directory

Assume you are in the situation of any of the previous examples but want to either not save the output, save it in `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or both extensions.

1) Load `gcamreport` library.

``` r
library(gcamreport)
```


2) Use [example1](#example1) database or [example2](#example2) project description and add all the extra parameters that you consider in the `run` function. Specify the output saving options through the `save_output` parameter

```r
## -- save the dataset in CSV and XLSX format
run(..., save_output = TRUE)    # this is the default option

## -- save the dataset only in CSV format
run(..., save_output = 'CSV')

## -- save the dataset only in XLSX format
run(..., save_output = 'XLSX')

## -- do not save the dataset
run(..., save_output = FALSE)
```



3) Use [example1](#example1) database or [example2](#example2) project description and add all the extra parameters that you consider in the `run` function. Specify the output directory and output file name through `file_name` parameter. This will save the output in the indicated path as `.csv` and `.xlsx`. To modify this, see the above explanation.

```r
## -- save the dataset in '/desired/directory' and in a file called 'awesomeOutput'
run(..., file_name = '/desired/directory/awesomeOutput')
```

## Troubleshooting for the `run()` function

#### A) Error on `run("path/to/your/data/myData.dat")`

In your R console, you might see this error:

    > run("path/to/your/data/myData.dat")
    [1] "Loading project..."
    [1] "Loading data, performing checks, and saving output..."
    [1] "ag_demand_clean"
    Error in rgcam::getQuery(prj, "demand balances by crop commodity") :
      getQuery: Query demand balances by crop commodity is not in any scenarios in the data set.

This problem is due to a wrong path specification.

**Possible solution**: make sure that you specified correctly the path. In addition:

-   In case you are using `gcamreport` package following the [R installation](#with-r), try to copy the whole path to your data, for instance `C:\Users\username\Documents\path\to\your\data\myData.dat` if you are using a Windows distribution.

-   In case you are using `gcamreport` package following the [Docker installation](#with-docker):

    a)  make sure that your data is inside the `gcamreport` folder.

    b)  make sure that you type correctly the path to your `gcamreport` folder when running the docker image (5th step in the [Docker section](#with-docker))

    c)  make sure that you are pointing correctly to your data. For example, if in the `gcamreport` folder you have a folder called `amazingData` with your dataset `myData.dat`, you should refer to it as

``` r
# option 1: full path
run("/app/amazingData/myData.dat")

# option 2: partial path
run("amazingData/myData.dat")
```

#### B) Error related to *system* when using the Docker installation.

Once the R console is opened, you might see this message after introducing any command:

    System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.
    Failed to connect to bus: Host is down
    Warning message:
    In system("timedatectl", intern = TRUE) :
       running command 'timedatectl' had status 1 

**Possible solution**: simply type `Ctrl+C` and run your command again.
