Each `gcamreport` release is linked either to a `GCAM` version or a study where GCAM was used. We follow a specific naming and tagging procedure for each release: they are all linked to a tag, whose name firstly contains two numbers indicating the compatible GCAM version (e.g. **v6.0** indicates that it is compatible with GCAM 6.0); the next number indicates the version release (e.g. v6.0.**0** indicates that it is the **first** release compatible with GCAM 6.0). This numeration starts from 0. Finally, if the release is linked to a project, the tag's name contains a hyphen and a key work (e.g. v6.0.0**-gas**).

Find below a description of all the releases:

| `gcamreport` tag-version | `GCAM` version and/or study        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| v6.0.1                     | GCAM 6.0                         |
| v6.0.0                     | GCAM 6.0                         |
| v6.0.0-gas                 | GCAM 6.0 with gas extra features |
